# Personal-Web-CI4

Personal web built using CodeIgniter 4, this is a rewrite of my [previous personal web](https://github.com/zakialawi02/personal-web) built using without Framework (pure HTML, CSS, and JavaScript).

The purpose of this project is to serve as a portfolio and a way for me to demonstrate my skills and experience to potential employers.

The website is built using PHP, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, using popular libraries and frameworks such as jQuery, and Font Awesome.

The website is responsive, and is optimized for both desktop and mobile devices.

I hope you enjoy visiting my personal web! Let me know if you have any questions or suggestions.
